## [1.6.0] - 2021-02-19
### Changed
- `toFormat` to `outputFormat` parameter to be consistent with sharp API. `toFormat` will still be supported until 2.0.

### Added
- when using the default request scheme (base64), outputOptions can now be passed to sharp.
  Example unencoded:
  ```json
    {
    "bucket": "my-bucket",
    "key": "my-image.jpg",
    "edits": {
      "resize": {
        "width": 300,
        "height": 300,
        "fit": "inside"
      }
    },
    "outputFormat": "webp",
    "outputOptions": {
      "nearLossless": true,
      "quality": 90
    }
  }
  ```

### Fixed
